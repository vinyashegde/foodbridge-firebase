## About us

Ending world hunger may seem like a big challenge, but sharing the excess food is a goal that can be achieved. Keeping this in mind, a team of four student developers from Pillai HOC College of Engineering and Technology, Navi Mumbai, worked throughout March to solve a concerning problem by leveraging tech.

Our website primarily deals with the welfare and agriculture sectors. Some food by many can fill one's stomach! We're here to make that happen. The Food Bridge, bridging the gap between food waste and hunger with sustainable agriculture.
